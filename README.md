# 3D_cell_simulation
Github repository for research paper *Towards large scale 3D modelling and simulation of the immune synapse*

For more installation instructions please refer to the simulation package folder README.

There is a README in the package_simulation/mcell_project/Blender-2.93-CellBlender for adding a nice addon to export geometry files from blender
to python. Highly recommended for generating meshes for simulations.
