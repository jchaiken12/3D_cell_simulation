# Project Directory
Here is where the simulation script was run. The contained sub directories are examples from the mcell team that work and
can be used to quickly test if the project is working correctly. 

## General Setup
Conda was used to manage the python version for the required minimum version of python desired of python 3.11 on the mcell website.
The parameter MCELL_PATH was set in the command line by:

    export MCELL_PATH=<install_path>/Blender-2.93-CellBlender/2.93/scripts/addons/cellblender/extensions/mcell

export MCELL_PATH=<install_path>/Blender-2.93-CellBlender/2.93/scripts/addons/cellblender/extensions/mcell
